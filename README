Title: 	MACS

Description:
	Daemon to keep track of machines that have been on the network, web
	interface to access the list and send pings / wake-on-lan packets to
	the machines.  Uses script at /etc/macs/macs to scan for and to store
	MAC addresses, IP addresses and hostnames in /etc/macs/macs.db.

Requires:
	Web server (e.g. apache/lighttpd) with PHP processor.
	nmap, perl, bash, awk, sed, tr, column, cron

Installation:
	Web interface goes to the root folder of your server (I use a Raspberry
	Pi / Debian / Lighttpd).
	For example, /var/www/public_html or /var/www/v-host/public_html.

	Open a port on your router and point it at the server (I use port 8080).

	Add '/etc/macs update' to root's crontab (I set this to run hourly).

	Enable wake-on-lan in BIOS and adapter config for any machines that you
	wish to remotely activate.

	Test your setup by accessing http://<your address>:<your port> from an
	external network.

Example:
	My work PC is quite power hungry, so I put it into S3 standby when not
	in use.  If I need to access it while I'm out, then I use the HTTP
	wake-on-lan interface provided by this package to turn the PC on, I
	then wait a few seconds for the PC to regain full network connectivity
	before finally connecting to it via my favourite remote-desktop
	software.

	The target PC can be running Windows or Linux, I've personally tested
	with Windows Server 2003 x64, Ubuntu 11.04 x64 and Arch x64.
